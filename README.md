Reflection/Purpose: This code is used to create the Trumpet Sim App, which can be found on Google Play. I created this application with the intention of applying my newly acquired knowledge and skills in the Java Programming Language. It can best be described as a fun project I did to combine my talents of trumpet playing and my programming skills. The code is quite messy and there are certainly better ways to go about it, but for a first time using Android Studio and with only about a month of experience with Java, I think I did pretty well.
